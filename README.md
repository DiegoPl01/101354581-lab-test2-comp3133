Hi, 
I hope you are doing well. 

For whomever it is reading this, on this repository you will find a personal project.
This is a react application which displays all mission launches from SpaceX through 2006 - 2020 using their REST API endpoint. 
It displays specifics from each mission and implements a search filter by year. 
I hope you enjoy trying it.

Thank you,
